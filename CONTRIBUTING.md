# Contributing

Thanks for choosing to contribute!

The following are a set of guidelines to follow when contributing to this project.

## Code Of Conduct

This project adheres to the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Have a question?

Start by filing an issue. The existing committers on this project work to reach consensus around project direction and issue solutions
within issue threads (when appropriate).

## Code Reviews

All submissions should come in the form of pull requests and need to be reviewed by project committers. Read
[GitHub's pull request documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on sending pull requests.

Lastly, please follow the [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) when submitting a pull request!

## Pull requests

Pull requests should be as lightweight and focused as possible with each PR addressing one issue (unless issues are otherwise
connected/related). After a pull request is approved, please squash and merge the PR using a [conventional commit syntax](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) (see below for
example).

```
type(scope?): subject #scope is optional, but should reference the package you are updating
```

## From Contributor To Committer

We love contributions from our community! If you'd like to go a step beyond contributor and become a committer with full write access and a
say in the project, you must be invited to the project. The existing committers employ an internal nomination process that must reach lazy
consensus (silence is approval) before invitations are issued. If you feel you are qualified and want to get more deeply involved, feel free
to reach out to existing committers to have a conversation about that.
